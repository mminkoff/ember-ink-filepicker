ember-ink-filepicker
====================

Find a new version of this demo at [https://github.com/mminkoff/ember-cli-filepicker-demo](https://github.com/mminkoff/ember-cli-filepicker-demo) using Ember-CLI and the [ember-cli-filepicker](https://github.com/DudaDev/ember-cli-filepicker) addon.

This is a relatively simple example of using the fantastic [Ink Filepicker](https://www.inkfilepicker.com/) with [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/). The [FilepickerController](https://github.com/mminkoff/ember-ink-filepicker/blob/master/javascripts/controllers/filepicker_controller.js) controls picking and populating the [image model](https://github.com/mminkoff/ember-ink-filepicker/blob/master/javascripts/models/ink_filepicker_image.js), which holds the file URL and other properties, providing enhancements such as image conversion and watermarking.  I hope you find this helpful!

You can see this in action [here](http://mminkoff.github.io/ember-ink-filepicker/).
